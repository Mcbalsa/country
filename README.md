<h2>Country Search</h2>
<p>This project is based on the React framework and utililizes the <a href src="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries API</a> to search for countries based on different types of criteria and select a country to view details on it. In these details, it would provide information such as the population, capital, subregion, languages, currencies, and timezones located in. Utilizing the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-google-maps/api">@react-google-maps/api</a> package, it will also display the country in google maps using latitude and longitude data provided from the REST countries API. The purpose of this project was to familiarize with the React framework as this was my first solo project to use this. I had a previous project for school for mobile development in Flutter that utizled also utilized the REST Countries API. This project taught me a few things about the React Framework which will be listed below</p></br>
